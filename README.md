The three files (Sphere_profile, Sphere_conarea and Sphere_fd) correspond to the matlab codes used in the main text for Fig. 8a (top), Fig. 8a (bottom), and Fig. 8b, respectively. They are used to compute the deformation profile of the thin film, the contact radius, and the force–displacement relationship under spherical indentation.

Corrigendum：Fig. 8.pdf:
The authors sincerely apologize for an error that occurred during the plotting process. Due to our previous use of an alternative nondimensionalization scheme before editing—specifically, we use “l_vdW=(Bσ^2/Γ)^{1/4}” instead of the final version presented in the main text, which uses “l_vdW=(Bσ^2/16Γ)^{1/4}”— an error in the code results in a mismatch between the parameter shown in Fig. 8 and the final nondimensionalization scheme adopted in the main text. With the final nondimensionalization approach presented in the text, Fig. 8a corresponds to the case with a dimensionless contact radius η=5. The solid lines in three different colors represent τ=0(purple), τ=25(blue) and τ=250(green). Also, R_s=200 for both Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b. Fortunately, this error is confined to Fig. 8 and does not affect any other equations or conclusions in the paper. A corrected version of high-resolution Fig. 8, with updated legends and captions, has been uploaded as Corrigendum: Fig. 8.pdf.
